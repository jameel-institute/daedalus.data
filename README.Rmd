_daedalus.data_ is a package and repository to handle input data files for [_daedalus_](https://jameel-institute.github.io/daedalus/), Jameel Institute's combined economic-epidemiological model of emerging respiratory pandemic diseases.


_daedalus.data_ prepares data objects to be used by the _daedalus_ (see [here](https://github.com/jameel-institute/daedalus)) model.

## Installation

You can install the development version of _daedalus.data_ from the Jameel Institute R-universe with:

```r
installation from R-universe
install.packages(
 "daedalus.data",
 repos = c(
   "https://jameel-institute.r-universe.dev", "https://cloud.r-project.org"
 )
)
```

or from GitHub [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jameel-institute/daedalus.data")
```

### Installation notes

Both _daedalus.data_ and _daedalus_ are under active development. To use them, always ensure you have the latest versions on main branch.

### Adding or modifying data

Follow these basic principles. Refer to the [_Data_ chapter in _R Packages_](https://r-pkgs.org/data.html) for guidance.

1. Add raw data (such as CSV files) under `inst/extdata`.

2. Add scripts that process raw data under `data-raw`. See existing scripts for guidance. In these scripts, use `usethis::use_data()` to save processed data into `data` as `.rda` files, which will be made available as package data.

    - To regenerate data, rerun these scripts.

3. Add documentation for package data under `R/<data_name>.R` See existing files such as `R/country_data.R` for guidance.

4. Document changes in the changelog `NEWS.md`.

## Quick start

This package contains the following data sets:
```r
data(package = "daedalus.data")
```

### Infections data

Users can select infection parameters from among seven epidemics caused by directly-transmitted viral respiratory pathogens, which are stored in the package as `daedalus.data::infection_data`, with epidemic identifiers stored as `daedalus.data::epidemic_names`.
